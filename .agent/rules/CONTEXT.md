## 🛠️ Core Tech Stack & Infrastructure

| Layer | Technology | Deployment Strategy (AWS) |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14/15, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, Zustand, TanStack Query | Static HTML Export (`output: 'export'`) deployed to **AWS S3** + **CloudFront CDN** (Serverless, cheap, high-scale). |
| **Backend API** | Laravel 11 (PHP 8.3) with **Laravel Octane** (RoadRunner/Swoole) | Containerized on **AWS ECS Fargate** (Serverless Container), balanced by **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**. |
| **Database** | MySQL 8.0 | **AWS RDS MySQL** (Multi-AZ in secure database subnets, no public access). |
| **Queue & Cache** | Redis | **AWS ElastiCache Redis** (Managed service for Laravel Horizon queue and session caching). |
| **WebSockets** | Pusher (Client/Broadcaster) or Soketi | Pusher Free Tier (to avoid self-hosting overhead) or Soketi container in Private Subnet. |
| **DevOps & IaC** | Terraform, Docker-compose, GitHub Actions | 100% Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via **Terraform**. Pipeline builds Docker, runs Pest tests, runs Trivy security scan, and triggers ECS Rolling Update. |

## 📏 System Rules & Security Guidelines

- **Decoupled Architecture**: Frontend and Backend communicate strictly via RESTful APIs. Frontend must be buildable as static files (Static SPA).
- **Facebook Webhook Queue Principle**: Webhook receiver must respond with `200 OK` in < 3 seconds. It must push payloads into the **Redis queue** (`Laravel Job`) for asynchronous processing to prevent timeout retries from Facebook.
- **Environment Isolation**:
  - **Local Dev**: Runs via Docker-compose. Webhooks are tunneled from Facebook using **Ngrok** or Cloudflare Tunnel to the Nginx local container port.
  - **Staging**: Pushed to `staging` branch, auto-deployed to staging AWS cluster for QA testing and Security Pentesting.
  - **Production**: Pushed to `main` branch, auto-deployed to AWS Production ECS and S3 + CloudFront CDN.
- **Security & SOC Rules (Thành viên 2)**:
  - All Facebook tokens must be encrypted in MySQL using Laravel Eloquent Encrypted Casts.
  - Periodic penetration testing (Pentest) on Staging APIs to prevent SQLi, CSRF, IDOR, and session hijacking.
  - Application audit log tracking of critical actions (e.g., changes to Auto-reply rules) linked to AWS CloudWatch alarms.

## 🚦 Engineering Discipline & Workflows
To avoid quality degradation, you must adhere to the engineering workflows defined in:
1.  **[Anti-Rationalization Guardrails](file:///r:/_Projects/Eurus_Workspace/Zeflyo/.agent/skills/anti_rationalization.md)**: Strictly counters common AI agent shortcuts regarding lack of testing, bypassing Terraform, and weak code reviews for team members.
2.  **[Slash Commands Lifecycle](file:///r:/_Projects/Eurus_Workspace/Zeflyo/.agent/skills/addy_commands.md)**: Operates under command-driven gates (`/spec`, `/plan`, `/build`, `/test`, `/review`, `/ship`) to enforce step-by-step SDLC compliance.
